  "body": "macOS LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nPython script that utilizes Open Directory to determine if the\r\nlocal administrator password has expired as specified by the Active Directory\r\nattribute dsAttrTypeNative:ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime. If this is the case\r\nthen a new randomly generated password will be set for the local admin account\r\nand a new expiration date will be set. The LAPS password is stored in the\r\nActive Directory attribute dsAttrTypeNative:ms-Mcs-AdmPwd. This attribute can\r\nonly be read by those designated to view the attribute. The computer record\r\ncan write to this attribute but it cannot read.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe following parameters must be set or the application will use the defaults:\r\n\r\n**LocalAdminAccount** - Local Administrator Account. Default is 'admin'  \r\n**DaysTillExpiration** - Expiration date of random password. Default is 60 Days  \r\n**PasswordLength** - Length of randomly generated password. Default is 8  \r\n\r\nThese parameters are set in the location /Libary/Preferences/edu.psu.macoslaps.plist\r\nor you can use your MDM's Custom Settings to set these values.\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n-------------------------\r\nAt this time you can clone the repo or download a zip of the repo or you can\r\nuse the package created using Packages to install. This script will run\r\n3 times a day between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nLogging\r\n-------\r\nThe script will also perform logging so that you know when the password is changed\r\nand its new expiration date or when the current unchanged password will expire. This\r\nfile is stored in /Library/Logs/ as macOSLAPS.log\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n--------\r\nI have only so far tested this in my environment so I would love for other people\r\nto test this and determine if it also fits their environment.\r\n\r\nKeychain\r\n--------\r\nI'd like to get some feedback on how we should handle the keychain since we are\r\nchanging the password to a random value.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n--------------\r\n* Rusty Myers - For helping to determine that Windows has its own time method vs\r\nEpoch time\r\n* Michael Lynn - For critiquing and assisting with generating the random password\r\n* Ben Toms - For sharing code from ADPassMon to query Active Directory with Open\r\nDirectory\r\n* Tom Burgin - For showing me the benefits and how to use Open Directory with Python\r\n* Per Olofsson - For also assisting with Open Directory commands\r\n* Clayton Burlison - For keeping my lack of markdown skills in check\r\n",
